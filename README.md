## Project Purpose
The main objectives of this project are:
- To develop a Java program to solve a specific problem or perform a particular task.
- To implement object-oriented programming principles and practices.
- To demonstrate proficiency in Java programming and software development.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
Throughout this project, I have gained and demonstrated skills in the following areas:
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Implementing classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- **Java Programming**: Writing clean, modular, and reusable code in Java.
- **Problem Solving**: Developing algorithms and logic to solve specific problems.
- **Error Handling**: Implementing error handling to ensure robust application performance.

## Project Impact
This project has helped me:
- **Enhance Practical Skills**: Applied theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios, improving my understanding of Java programming and object-oriented principles.
- **Improve Problem-Solving Abilities**: Developed solutions for specific problems and implemented them in Java.
- **Develop Application Design**: Learned to design and implement an effective object-oriented application.

## Files Included
- `CMIS242ASG4LoganToms.java`: The main Java file that contains the logic for the application.

## Usage Instructions
